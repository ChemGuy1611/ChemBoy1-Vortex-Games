# Changelog

## Planned Future Changes (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)

- Change CDLC Song Downloader to open a free-roam browser window so that domain switching to file hosting sites for the .psarc files does not cause exit errors and allows downloading multiple files in one session.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-20

- Added Root modtype and installer for known .psarc files and folders (i.e. cache.psarc).
- Added tool to launch Unpack-Repack tool.

## [0.1.2] - 2025-03-29

- Fixed ASIO4ALL installer not running because it requires elevation.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-03-28

- Added ASIO4ALL installer to Optional Mods notification (required for RS_ASIO to work)
- Moved CFSM to Optional mods notification (not truly a requirement)
- Removed unnecessary modtypes for mods that are installed by executables, not as mods in Vortex (RSMods, CDLC Enabler, DLC Builder)
- Running CFSM no longer blocks the user from launching the game
- Added tool to launch the game with custom arguments (arguments provided by the user)
- Condensed browse-to-download functions into a repeatable function
- Added button to open Vortex downloads folder for the game

## Special Features

- **Deploy Hook** (`did-deploy`) — runs custom logic (e.g., notifications, metadata patching) every time mods are deployed.
- **Purge Hook** (`did-purge`) — runs custom logic when mods are purged.
- **Auto-Downloader** — can automatically download required tools (mod loader, managers, etc.).
- **FOMOD Awareness** — installers check for and skip `fomod/ModuleConfig.xml` to avoid conflicts with the built-in FOMOD installer.
- **Version Detection** — detects game version (Steam/Xbox/GOG/Demo) and adjusts paths accordingly.

## How Mod Installation Works

```
User drops archive into Vortex
  └── Each installer's test() runs in priority order
       └── First supported=true wins
            └── install() returns copy instructions + setmodtype
                 └── Vortex stages files
                      └── User deploys
                           └── Vortex links/copies to game folder
                                └── did-deploy fires → post-deploy logic runs
```

## Entry Point

The extension is registered via `module.exports = { default: main }`. The `main(context)` function calls `applyGame(context, spec)` which registers the game, mod types, installers, and actions with Vortex.

# Changelog

## [0.4.3]
- Removed an obsolete parameter that caused downloading updates from the Moddding Tools domain, including Fluffy MM, to fail with wrong URL
- Removed 'site' from compatibleDownloads, as it would cause all mods from the Modding Tools domain the user has installed to show up as uninstalled mods in the mod list

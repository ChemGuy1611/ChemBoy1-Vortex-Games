- Fixed: input undefined error when downloading Fluffy Mod Manager
- Fixed: path strings
- Added: Buttons to open Downloads folder, PCGamingWiki page, view changelog, and submit bug reports

## [0.4.3]

- Removed an obsolete parameter that caused downloading updates from the Moddding Tools domain, including Fluffy MM, to fail with wrong URL

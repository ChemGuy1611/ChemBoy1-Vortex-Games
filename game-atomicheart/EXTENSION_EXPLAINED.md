## Special Features

- **Load Order** — mods are assigned numbered folder names or sorted based on their position in the load order.
- **UE4SS Load Order** — manages UE4SS script/DLL mod load order via a dedicated page; serializes order to `mods.txt` on deploy.
- **Deploy Hook** (`did-deploy`) — runs custom logic (e.g., notifications, metadata patching) every time mods are deployed.
- **Purge Hook** (`did-purge`) — runs custom logic when mods are purged.
- **Auto-Downloader** — can automatically download required tools (mod loader, managers, etc.).
- **FOMOD Awareness** — installers check for and skip `fomod/ModuleConfig.xml` to avoid conflicts with the built-in FOMOD installer.
- **Xbox Game Pass Support** — detects Xbox version of the game and adjusts executable/launcher accordingly.
- **Version Detection** — detects game version (Steam/Xbox/GOG/Demo) and adjusts paths accordingly.

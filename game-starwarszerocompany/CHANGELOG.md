## Planned Improvements (Not Yet Released)

- Game version now shows the real game build instead of the Unreal engine version.
- Fixed: Mod files with no file extension were skipped during installation
- Added an "Open SteamDB Page" button next to the PCGamingWiki one.
- The various "Open X Folder"/"Open X Page" buttons now show an error message if the folder or page can't be opened, instead of failing silently.
- Fixed: Mods packaged inside an outer folder whose name ends with the name of an expected folder (for example "MyContent" for "Content") now install into the right place instead of keeping part of the outer folder's name.
- Fixed: Blueprint (LogicMods) mods with an upper-case ".PAK" extension now get the correct name on the LogicMods load order.
- Fixed: The "Open LogicMods Folder" button now opens the LogicMods folder instead of the Paks folder.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-06

- Fixed: Locked load order entries could be moved out of position when using "Move to Top", "Move to Bottom" or the position number box on another entry. Locked entries now keep their place.
- Fixed: The load order position number box now accepts low numbers even when a locked entry is further down the list.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-27

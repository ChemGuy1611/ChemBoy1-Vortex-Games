# template-tfcinstaller-ue2-3 Changelog

## [2026-08-21]

- Changed: the `api` constant is now declared at the top of `context.once()` rather than inside the `did-deploy` handler, and every call in the block goes through it instead of `context.api`.

## [2026-08-10]

- Changed: `hasXbox` is now derived from the active discovery IDs. It is declared with `let` and initialised to `false`, followed by `if (DISCOVERY_IDS_ACTIVE.includes(XBOXAPP_ID)) hasXbox = true;`, so adding the Xbox app ID to `DISCOVERY_IDS_ACTIVE` is enough to switch on the Xbox version logic. Setting the initialiser to `true` still forces it on for games that need it without an Xbox ID in the list.

## [2026-07-29]

- Changed: scaffold version raised from 0.1.0 to 1.0.0 in `info.json`, the `CHANGELOG.md` entry, the `index.js` header block, and the version marker `.txt` filename. Extensions created from this template now start at 1.0.0.

## [2026-07-01]

- Changelog tracking started for this template.

## Mod Types

Mod types define where each category of mod gets deployed:

| Name | ID | Priority | Target Path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mod | `madmax-mod` | high | `{gamePath}/.` |
| Root Folder | `madmax-root` | high | `{gamePath}` |

## Mod Installers

Installers run in priority order (lower number = tested first). The first installer whose test returns `supported: true` handles the archive.

## Special Features

- **Auto-Downloader** — can automatically download required tools (mod loader, managers, etc.).
- **FOMOD Awareness** — installers check for and skip `fomod/ModuleConfig.xml` to avoid conflicts with the built-in FOMOD installer.
- **GOG Support** — detects GOG version with adjusted executable/data paths.
- **Registry Lookup** — uses Windows registry for game detection or configuration paths.
- **Version Detection** — detects game version (Steam/Xbox/GOG/Demo) and adjusts paths accordingly.

## How Mod Installation Works

```
User drops archive into Vortex
  └── Each installer's test() runs in priority order
       └── First supported=true wins
            └── install() returns copy instructions + setmodtype
                 └── Vortex stages files
                      └── User deploys
                           └── Vortex links/copies to game folder
```

## Entry Point

The extension is registered via `module.exports = { default: main }`. The `main(context)` function calls `applyGame(context, spec)` which registers the game, mod types, installers, and actions with Vortex.
